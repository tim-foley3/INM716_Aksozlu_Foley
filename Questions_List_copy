THEME:
AI's interpretation on Human Passion
OR
AI's interpretation on Everyday Human Life


TARGET EACH PIECE OF ART AT SPECIFIC AUDIENCES (e.g. memes for genZ/alpha, tools for millenials/genX, etc.).

Brainstorming:
partying - Emotions -GAN
coding
feats of engineering - impressive structures
Music concerts
Fear - rollercoaster / 
Webcame perspectives of humans in the middle of their things
...
...
etc. add more here


Potential Projects/models:

Neural Style Transfer
GANs
MIDAS (Depth) (into style transfer)


Questions for Ed:


1. NFTs - is it enough to just mint the NFTs for the 5 marks?
2. Social Media Presence - Is it necessary to have the artwork on multiple social media platforms for more marks, or is it equally viable to just have say on instagram?
3. Does he mind if we have our own url or not i.e. is github.io fine to use or more marks for custom url?
4. Elevator pitch - is this individual or given jointly in the group?
5. Is our theme too broad? (Human Passion)


Stuff to work on:

1. From MIDAS to Neural Style Transfer (random dataset is fine)
2. Webpage: Choose at least one project (e.g. parties) and upload the artwork for it (not finalised) with decriptions and paypal links.
3. Link a few models together on runway under the theme of human passion - draft finalised image uploaded to website
